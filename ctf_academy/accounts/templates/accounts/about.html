        About CTF Academy
    </h1>

        <p class="fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
            CTF Academy was built on the idea that cybersecurity isn’t just about throwing payloads at a system until something breaks. Real security work demands logical thinking — understanding structures, dependencies, and the way layers of defense fit together. That’s the focus here.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
            Our challenges don’t simulate the chaos of an entire operating system or a raw network. Instead, they take place in a controlled, sandboxed environment where the noise is stripped away. You get to focus on reasoning through topologies, identifying weak points in layered defenses, and applying strategies step by step — the kind of thinking that matters in real-world offensive security.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
            We took inspiration from platforms like LeetCode, which prove every day that regular practice sharpens skill more than any lecture, video, or book. CTF Academy takes that same model and applies it to security: small, consistent exercises that train your problem-solving muscle.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
            The platform also comes from what we’ve seen at our own university, <span class="text-white font-semibold">Cebu Institute of Technology – University</span>. Programming foundations often get a lot of attention, while networking and system-level concepts remain underexplored. CTF Academy is our way of bridging that gap — giving students a steady, hands-on path into offensive security through structured challenges, leaderboards, and streaks that reward persistence.

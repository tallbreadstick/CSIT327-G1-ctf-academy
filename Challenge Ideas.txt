1. Baby Steps (Easy)

- Target host machine exposes endpoint for flag
- Endpoint does not provide authentication
- Simply connect to the endpoint and take the flag

2. Ring Around The Rosie (Medium)

- The challenge has multiple host machines in a ring topology
- Each host machine contains a flag to capture
- Each host machine exposes an endpoint for flag capture, but requires a password
- Each host machine also contains a vulnerable entry that reveals the password to the next host
- Follow the ring and capture all the flags

3. Binary Search Password (Medium)

- A single host machine contains the flag to capture
- The host machine exposes a password guarded endpoint
- If the given password is wrong, it reveals whether the one you provided was lexicographically lower or higher than required
- Binary search the password using the endpoint's feedback to narrow the search for the real password

4. PIN Crack (Easy)

- A single host machine guards the flag behind an endpoint that accepts a 4-digit PIN code
- Use simple brute force checking to crack the PIN and capture the flag

5. Needle In Haystack (Hard)

- The challenge contains several host machines
- The user will have to leverage scripts to crawl the network and locate the flag
- Each host has relatively weak security which should be easy to crawl and crack

6. Bobby Tables (Easy)

- The challenge contains a single host machine
- Connecting its server gives a form for student information entry
- Drop the whole 'student' table in order to pass the challenge
- Use an SQL injection on the form to drop the table

7. Location On The Flyer (Easy)

- A single host machine provides a web page containing some forms
- The developers got lazy and put some secret keys in their frontend code
- View the page source and use the secret keys to breach their security

8. We Will Rock You (Easy)

- A popular social media page has had all its passwords leaked
- A certain user of this platform is your target
- Use the leaks to brute force crack their password

9. Identity Theft (Medium)

- The challenge contains two host machines
- One host's firewall rules only allow connections from the other host
- The other host has weaker auth which can be exploited
- Use the other host to access the secure host and capture the flag

10. Crawl And Conquer (Hard)

- The challenge contains several host machines, each with strict firewall rules
- Each host only allows another random host in the network to connect to it
- If all host dependents form a graph, there will end up at least 1 disjoint graphs
- Each connected graph has 1 weak link, which can directly be accessed publicly
- Find the weak links, crawl through the network, and capture all flags on every host machine

11. Man In The Middle I (Medium)

- Two host machines are in a single network
- Both hosts regularly share information through messages
- This transmission channel is over an unencrypted HTTP connection
- Use a packet analyzer to find secrets and capture the flag

12. Man In The Middle II (Medium)

- Two host machines are regularly communicating over a HTTP stream
- The protocol is unencrypted, but another encryption layer occurs in their backend
- Part of their shared encryption strategy relies on sending a key before the message
- Intercept the key and use it to decrypt any messages
- Find the secret among the decrypted messages to capture the flag

13. Plaintext Passwords (Easy)

- A host machine exposes a service with an auth layer
- The database stores the passwords as plain text
- Use an SQL Injection attack to leak user passwords
- Log into their auth service using these leaks to capture the flag

14. Session Hijack (Medium)

- Two host machines are connected on the same network
- One is a client to the other's web service
- The client has already logged in over a secure channel
- However, the client's machine is vulnerable and you can take their auth token
- Inject their valid token into your own requests to bypass validation to capture the flag

15. Minotaur's Labyrinth (Hard)

- A large network contains ~30 hosts
- Each host is either a keystore or a gateway
- Gateways lead to other gateways by firewall restrictions
- Gateways need to compute a hash from a certain set of keystores to move to the next one
- The final gateway reaches a central, otherwise inaccessible host which carries the flag
- Gateways are scheduled to be reassigned to new keystores periodically
- Keystores are also scheduled to periodically rotate their keys
- Gateways have rate-limited APIs, so one cannot excessively make queries
- Challengers must utilize scripts to crawl the network and uncover secrets before they change
- Find the weakest link at any given moment and crawl up the chain to reach the flag

16. Starry Starry Night (Hard)

- A service on a central network is receiving traffic from a larger open network
- This traffic comes in the form of packets of "game data" which is filtered by an anti-cheat software
- This software uses statistical models to validate packets as natural or flag them for cheats
- The goal of this challenge is to send some large number of cheat packets and pass them off as natural
- Use a series of packet sniffers to collect data across the network and learn the natural skewness of the distribution
- Once enough packets bypass the system without being flagged for cheating, the flag has been captured

17. Root Cause (Easy)

- A single host contains a flag to capture
- This host guards the flag behind root privileges
- This challenge provides you with a payload that exploits an OS-level vulnerability and escalates privileges
- Use this to SSH into the remote terminal and seize the flag
